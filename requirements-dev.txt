# Dev requirements for working on this plugin *against a local Picard source tree*.
#
# Assumptions:
# - Picard is checked out at f:/repos/picard
# - The plugin repo uses a local venv (./.venv)
# - PYTHONPATH includes f:/repos/picard (see .env)
#
# These packages are needed so that importing picard.plugin3.api works in the
# plugin dev environment (Picard imports depend on Qt + a few runtime deps).
